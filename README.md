Titanic Survival Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features such as age, sex, passenger class, and fare. It demonstrates the full machine learning workflow: data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the model.

Dataset
The dataset used is the Titanic passenger data from the Kaggle Titanic Competition. It includes passenger details like age, sex, ticket class, and survival status.

Project Structure
notebooks/ — Jupyter notebooks (Google Colab) containing the analysis and model building

data/ — Dataset files (train.csv, test.csv)

README.md — Project description and instructions

Steps Performed
Data loading and exploration

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feature encoding and engineering

Model training using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest

Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

Saving the best performing model

How to Run
Clone the repository

Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter

Run cells sequentially to follow the workflow

Results
The best model achieved an accuracy of approximately XX% on the test data.

Future Work
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

Trying advanced models like XGBoost or neural networks

Building a simple web app to interact with the model
