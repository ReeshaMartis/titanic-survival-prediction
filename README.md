# titanic-survival-prediction

Project Overview:
This project aims to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features such as age, sex, passenger class, and fare. It demonstrates the full machine learning workflow: data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the model.

Dataset:
The dataset used is the Titanic passenger data from the Kaggle Titanic Competition <https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data>. It includes passenger details like age, sex, ticket class, and survival status.

Project Structure:
1. notebooks/ — Jupyter notebooks (Google Colab) containing the analysis and model building
2. data/ — Dataset files (train.csv, test.csv)
3. README.md — Project description and instructions

Steps Performed:
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature encoding and engineering
4. Model training using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
5. Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
6. Saving the best performing model

How to Run:
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter
3. Run cells sequentially to follow the workflow

Results:
The best model achieved an accuracy of approximately XX% on the test data.

Future Work:
1. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
2. Trying advanced models like XGBoost or neural networks
3. Building a simple web app to interact with the model
